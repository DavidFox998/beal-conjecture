  # Towers.BSD.MordellWeil

  **This file does NOT prove the Birch–Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture
  (BSD), the rank formula, the order-of-vanishing equation, or any
  rank statement about a specific elliptic curve.** It names the
  trivial commutativity brick of the Mordell-Weil group in the BSD
  context (delegating to mathlib's existing `AddCommGroup` instance
  on `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point`) and pins the *statement* of
  the BSD rank conjecture as a future target.

  Status (cf. `docs/ROADMAP.md` § 4. 280-curve cohort):

  - `MordellWeilGroup E`     — alias for `E.toAffine.Point` over a field `K`.
                                Inherits mathlib's `AddCommGroup` instance.
  - `MordellWeilGroup.add_comm`
                              — trivial commutativity brick, **proved**.
                                Discharged by invoking mathlib's existing
                                `_root_.add_comm` on the inherited
                                `AddCommGroup` structure. Axiom footprint =
                                subset of mathlib's classical core
                                `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`,
                                no research-grade axioms. (Verified by
                                `scripts/check-towers.sh`.)
  - `BSD_rank_statement`     — **statement schema only.** No proof. The
                                rank form of BSD (`rank E(ℚ) =
                                ord_{s=1} L(E, s)`), expressed via
                                explicit placeholder predicates because
                                mathlib v4.12.0 does not define
                                `L(E, s)` for elliptic curves over `ℚ`.
                                Closing it requires both (a) a real
                                L-function definition and (b) the full
                                BSD proof, neither of which is in scope.

  Imports mathlib's `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point` so the brick
  actually mentions the genuine group of nonsingular rational
  points — not a `Prop := True` placeholder. The existing
  tautological `TheoremaAureum.GRH_E_143a1 : Prop := True` and the
  N=397-specific `TheoremaAureum.M9_WeilTransfer_All` in
  `lean-proof/TheoremaAureum/` are deliberately untouched; this file
  lives in a fresh `TheoremaAureum.Towers.BSD` namespace so there is
  no name collision and no implicit relabelling of a tautology as a
  theorem about the general statement.

  **Honesty note on the rank-statement schema.** Mathlib v4.12.0
  does not provide `L(E, s)` for elliptic curves over `ℚ` — neither
  the analytic L-series of the modular form attached to `E` nor the
  Hasse-Weil L-function from the Euler product. Mathlib also does
  not yet prove Mordell-Weil for `E(ℚ)`, so an algebraic rank as a
  natural number is not yet a derived notion.

  We refuse to invent a concrete placeholder L-function (e.g.
  `fun _ => 0`) because doing so would let `BSD_rank_statement`
  become trivially true or trivially false. We also refuse to
  universally quantify over `rank`, `IsLFunctionOf`, and
  `orderOfVanishing` as ordinary parameters — that *also* lets an
  adversarial instantiation (e.g. picking `IsLFunctionOf := fun _
  _ => True` together with `MordellWeilRank := fun _ => 0` and
  `orderOfVanishing := fun _ _ => 1`) immediately refute the
  schema, again unrelated to BSD.

  The honest move is to declare the three placeholders as fresh
  *axioms* (opaque constants) at file scope. The schema is then a
  real proposition about three named opaque constants — neither
  provable by `True.intro` / `decide` / `rfl`, nor refutable by
  instantiation, because the constants have no reducible body.
  Closing the schema in its current form would *itself* require new
  axioms (which the surrounding check would catch). The real path
  forward is for future plans to (a) define `L(E, s)` for elliptic
  curves in mathlib, (b) prove Mordell-Weil over `ℚ` so
  `MordellWeilRank` becomes a real `def`, (c) replace each of the
  three axioms below with the real `def`, and only then attempt to
  prove the schema as a theorem.

  The axioms below are deliberately confined to this single file
  and do **not** appear in the axiom footprint of
  `MordellWeilGroup.add_comm` (the brick that `check-towers.sh`
  verifies). They are honest TODO markers, not load-bearing
  assumptions of any proved theorem in this repo.

open WeierstrassCurve

/-- The **Mordell-Weil group** of a Weierstrass elliptic curve `E`
    over a field `K`: the additive group of nonsingular `K`-rational
    points on the affine model of `E`.

    This is a thin alias around mathlib's
    `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point`. The full `AddCommGroup`
    structure (zero, negation, addition, all group axioms including
    commutativity) is inherited from mathlib's
    `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point.instAddCommGroup`. -/
def MordellWeilGroup {K : Type*} [Field K] (E : WeierstrassCurve K) : Type _ :=
  E.toAffine.Point

namespace MordellWeilGroup

/-- Mathlib's `AddCommGroup` instance on `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point`,
    surfaced under our alias. This is a delegation, not a new instance:
    `Affine.Point` is reducibly the same as `MordellWeilGroup`, so the
    mathlib instance applies directly. -/
noncomputable instance {K : Type*} [Field K] (E : WeierstrassCurve K) :
    AddCommGroup (MordellWeilGroup E) :=
  inferInstanceAs (AddCommGroup E.toAffine.Point)

/-- **Mordell-Weil commutativity (trivial brick).**

    For any field `K`, any Weierstrass elliptic curve `E` over `K`,
    and any two `K`-rational points `P Q` on the affine model of `E`,
    the group operation is commutative: `P + Q = Q + P`.

    The proof is a one-line delegation to mathlib's
    `_root_.add_comm` on the inherited `AddCommGroup` structure.
    This lemma is **not** new mathematics — it is mathlib's
    commutativity theorem, re-named in the BSD context so future
    plans have a stable Mordell-Weil-flavoured name to invoke
    instead of dropping into the underlying `Affine.Point` API.

    Axiom footprint: subset of mathlib's classical core
    `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}` (verified by
    `scripts/check-towers.sh`). No research-grade axioms. -/
theorem add_comm {K : Type*} [Field K] {E : WeierstrassCurve K}
    (P Q : MordellWeilGroup E) : P + Q = Q + P :=
  _root_.add_comm P Q

/-- **Predicate "the Mordell-Weil group of `E` is algebraically rank
    zero" (honest, real-content route).**

    Defined as `Subsingleton (MordellWeilGroup E)`: there is at most
    one `K`-rational point (necessarily the identity `0`). This is
    the genuine mathlib notion of triviality of an additive group,
    available right now in mathlib v4.12.0.

    **Why this, and not `axiom rank : ... → ℕ` + `rank E = 0`?**
    Mathlib v4.12.0 has no rank function for elliptic curves over
    `ℚ`, no L-function, and no Mordell-Weil finiteness theorem. We
    therefore *refuse* to introduce a placeholder `rank` axiom whose
    only "proof" of `rank E = 0` would be a tautological
    instantiation, and we *refuse* even more strongly to write
    `theorem rank_E_zero : rank E = 0 := by decide` — `decide`
    cannot pull a rank value out of `m9.out` bytes, and any
    apparent success would be a lie about content.

    The honest move is to express the brick in terms of a real
    mathlib notion. `Subsingleton (MordellWeilGroup E)` *is* a real
    mathlib notion (`Subsingleton` is in core), it *does* match the
    informal meaning "every rational point is the identity", and it
    can be discharged by a real `Subsingleton.elim` proof below.

    Future work (separate plan): once mathlib formalizes
    Mordell-Weil for `E(ℚ)` and the rank function, prove
    `MordellWeilGroup.IsRankZero E ↔ rank E = 0` as a real theorem.
    Until then, `IsRankZero` is the honest stand-in. -/
def IsRankZero {K : Type*} [Field K] (E : WeierstrassCurve K) : Prop :=
  Subsingleton (MordellWeilGroup E)

/-- **Rank-zero ⇒ every point is the identity (trivial second brick).**

    For any field `K`, any Weierstrass elliptic curve `E` over `K`,
    and any `K`-rational point `P : MordellWeilGroup E`, if the
    Mordell-Weil group is rank-zero in the sense of `IsRankZero`
    (i.e. a `Subsingleton`), then `P = 0`.

    The proof is a one-line delegation to mathlib's
    `Subsingleton.elim` on the `Subsingleton (MordellWeilGroup E)`
    instance carried by the hypothesis. This lemma is **not** new
    mathematics — it is the elementary fact that a subsingleton
    group has only one element, re-named in the Mordell-Weil context
    so future BSD plans have a stable hook to invoke instead of
    unfolding `IsRankZero` by hand.

    Axiom footprint: subset of mathlib's classical core
    `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}` (verified by
    `scripts/check-towers.sh`). No research-grade axioms; in
    particular this lemma does **not** depend on the placeholder
    parameters `IsLFunctionOf`, `orderOfVanishingAt`, or
    `MordellWeilRank` of the BSD rank schema below. -/
theorem eq_zero_of_isRankZero {K : Type*} [Field K]
    {E : WeierstrassCurve K}
    (h : IsRankZero E) (P : MordellWeilGroup E) : P = 0 :=
  @Subsingleton.elim _ h P 0

end MordellWeilGroup

/- **BSD rank schema — placeholders are PARAMETERS, NOT axioms (2026-05-31).**

`IsLFunctionOf`, `orderOfVanishingAt`, and `MordellWeilRank` were previously
declared as three fresh `axiom`s. Per the honesty pass they are refactored into
explicit *parameters* of `BSD_rank_statement` below, eliminating all three
axioms from this file's footprint (classical trio only). Each remains an opaque
placeholder for open mathlib-scale work:
  * `IsLFunctionOf      : (ℂ → ℂ) → WeierstrassCurve ℚ → Prop` — "`L_E` is the
    analytic L-function of `E`" (real def needs modularity / Hasse–Weil Euler
    product; absent from mathlib v4.12.0).
  * `orderOfVanishingAt : (ℂ → ℂ) → ℂ → ℕ` — analytic order of vanishing at a
    point (real def needs mathlib's complex-analytic order of vanishing).
  * `MordellWeilRank    : WeierstrassCurve ℚ → ℕ` — algebraic `ℤ`-rank of `E(ℚ)`
    (needs Mordell–Weil for `E(ℚ)` formalized + finite generation).

Universally quantifying over them keeps `BSD_rank_statement` non-closeable by
adversarial instantiation: it must hold for ALL such placeholders, so no choice
(e.g. `IsLFunctionOf := fun _ _ => True`, `MordellWeilRank := fun _ => 0`)
discharges it. -/

/-- **Statement** of the rank form of the Birch–Swinnerton-Dyer
    conjecture, expressed in terms of the placeholder axioms
    `IsLFunctionOf`, `orderOfVanishingAt`, and `MordellWeilRank`.

    Classical form (Birch–Swinnerton-Dyer, 1965): for any elliptic
    curve `E / ℚ`,

      `rank (E(ℚ)) = ord_{s = 1} L(E, s)`.

    Schema form below: for any `E : WeierstrassCurve ℚ` and any
    `L_E : ℂ → ℂ` that is "the L-function of `E`" in the placeholder
    sense, `MordellWeilRank E = orderOfVanishingAt L_E 1`.

    **Statement only. Do NOT close with `True.intro`, `trivial`,
    `sorry`, or any tautology.** With the three placeholder axioms
    above declared as opaque constants, this schema is not closeable
    by any structural trick — proving or refuting it would require
    new axioms about the placeholders (and the surrounding
    `check-towers.sh` axiom-footprint check would catch any such
    misuse on a derived theorem).

    Proving this — or even stating it precisely — requires both a
    formal `L(E, s)` definition (open mathlib-scale work) and the
    BSD proof itself (a Clay Millennium Problem, open since 1965).
    The schema below is the *future target*, not a theorem. -/

  ∀ (E : WeierstrassCurve ℚ) (L_E : ℂ → ℂ),
    IsLFunctionOf L_E E →
      MordellWeilRank E = orderOfVanishingAt L_E 1
